# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement

The telecom industry faces significant challenges due to high customer churn rates, leading to revenue loss. Our objective is to develop predictive models to identify high-risk churn customers, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Business Problem Overview

Telecom companies experience substantial churn rates due to competitive markets, with 15-25% annual churn. Retaining high-value customers is crucial for profitability. To address this, we aim to predict customer churn and understand the key indicators driving it.

## Understanding and Defining Churn

Churn, a critical metric in the industry, can vary between postpaid and prepaid models. Prepaid churn, common in our market, requires careful definition due to customer behavior nuances.

## Definitions of Churn

Churn can be defined based on usage, such as zero activity over a period. We focus on usage-based churn to capture customer behavior effectively.

## High-value Churn

Identifying high-value customers, driving a significant portion of revenue, is essential. We aim to predict churn for these customers specifically to minimize revenue loss.

## Understanding the Business Objective and the Data

We analyze four months of customer-level data to predict churn in the ninth month. Understanding typical customer behavior during churn phases is key to achieving our objective.

## Understanding Customer Behavior During Churn

We categorize customer lifecycles into "good," "action," and "churn" phases, enabling effective prediction and intervention strategies.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation involves deriving new features, filtering high-value customers, tagging churners, and removing churn phase attributes to ensure model accuracy.

## Modelling

We build predictive models to identify churn risks and understand influential factors. We employ PCA for dimensionality reduction and various classification techniques to handle class imbalance effectively.

## Recommendations

We recommend proactive retention strategies based on model insights to mitigate customer churn effectively.

## Conclusion

Our project aims to provide telecom companies with actionable insights to retain high-value customers and minimize revenue loss due to churn.
